				        <h1>I am Dan Berkowitz</h1>
				        <h2>Designer, writer, user, quester, and student.</h2>
				        <p>I'm a graduate of the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University. I majored in graphic design and, as a secondary interest, I specialized in sociology.</p>
				        <p>I am interested in making information more accessible to people, and understanding why and how people choose to act. Whether it be using scientific data or brand messages, my goal is to help people understand what they're reading, become engrossed in what they're viewing, and be inspired by what they've learned. In the end, I want to empower people to make informed decisions by communicating to them what they need to know, and by crafting targeted experiences that enable them to utilize their newfound knowledge.</p>

				        <p>I have coded this website from scratch (excluding <a href="http://4nf.org/">the Ajaxify library</a> &mdash; many thanks to its helpful creator, Arvind Gupta!). However, please note that it is still a work in progress. Much of the text is still being edited â€” case studies for my design work, improved contact information, and so on. If you run into any problems, please contact me.</p>
