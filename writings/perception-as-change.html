		        	<p>Humans, as a species, are adept at convincing ourselves — on both individual and collective levels — that what we believe is the same as what is. We shape our perspectives of the world to match our expectations, and therefore assume that our perspectives represent objective reality. Instead, the truth is that our societal biases and prerogatives act as lenses through which we view ourselves and our place in nature. As our cultural values and dreams change, so do our fundamental perceptions of the world. This cycle of subjective invention and destruction is described in Robert Romanyshyn’s <cite class="title">Technology as Symptom and Dream</cite>: “We invent the body and the nature that we need. We invent the nature and the body which suit our world.” <cite>(Romanyshyn 1989: 111)</cite>. For the most part, this invention is not a conscious act by individuals or groups; it is a gradual evolutionary process that results from the shifting dynamics of technology, science, society, religion, and economic forces, such as capitalism.</p>
		        	<p>The invention of the nature and the body serves to furnish humanity with power and control, while simultaneously sanctioning its exploitation and modification of the natural, physical world in pursuit of domination and growth. In pre-modern cultures, nature existed as “…a nurturing mother: a kindly beneficent female who provided for the needs of mankind in an ordered, planned universe.” <cite>(Merchant 1980: 2)</cite>. This dominant imagery was apropos when humanity coexisted with nature in a reciprocal and intimate union — Mother Nature provided, and humans gave thanks and propitiations. Farmers made sacrifices to insure good harvests. Hunters said prayers over the bodies of their prey. Nature was celebrated, respected, and loved as a divine figure. But, as all things must, humanity inevitably outgrew this mutual relationship. Power became the driving force behind human growth, and the most expedient way to create power was to control the resources upon which others relied. Nature could no longer be trusted to guard its own bounty. “Two new ideas, those of mechanism and of the domination and master of nature, became core concepts of the modern world. An organically oriented mentality in which female principles played an important role was undermined and replaced by a mechanically oriented mentality that either eliminated or used female principles in an exploitative manner.” <cite>(Merchant 1980: 2)</cite>.</p>
		        	
		        	<p>Science, with its intrinsic goal of discovering and mastering the secrets of nature, was a primary impetus behind this shift. As David Hess writes in <cite class="title">Science and Technology in a Multicultural World</cite>, “…science was a masculine activity in which the task was to watch, classify, order, and dominate a natural world…” <cite>(Hess 1995: 83)</cite>. Science was labeled as masculine and nature as feminine, shifting the power dynamic of gender toward the man. The female figure was diminished, relegated to the level of witchcraft and consorting with the supernatural — that which science itself could not explain (and so feared).</p>
		        	
		        	<p>As a result of this new scientific hegemony, the processes of commercialism and industrialization arose. In order for science to continue accumulating knowledge, new technologies had to be created that facilitated more advanced forms of investigation (e.g. the telescope, the laboratory, the x-ray, etc.). And, as these new technologies led to even more discoveries, the newly gained knowledge was then applied to the creation of even more technologies, some of which purported to solve problems that people had been experiencing for hundreds of years. But, in order to keep the rate of progress constant (and, they hoped, increasing), new resources needed to be mined, refined, stripped, extracted, hewn, processed, and utilized with an ever increasing rapidity.</p>

		        	<p>The modern invention of nature has its benefits — scientific knowledge and technologies that help feed, shelter, clothe, and educate people around the world. However, these benefits pale before the deleterious effects that occur when modern nature is coupled with capitalism’s uncontrollable growth and remorseless exploitation. The environment has been damaged, possibly beyond repair, due to destructive and toxic practices — air pollution, strip mining, deforestation, dumping of poisonous materials in the oceans and fresh water bodies, and so on — which have caused climate change to begin. “…The World Health Organization estimated in 2004 the loss of 150,000 [more] lives each year due to climate change. Its most recent report projects that loss of life…could double by 2030.” <cite>(Speth 2008: 24)</cite>.</p>

		        	<p>Around the same time, the rise of Protestantism contributed to what Hess calls the rationalization of society. In these new rational Protestant societies, the people became “…increasingly governed by more complicated bureaucracies, increased differentiation of functions, and ever more elaborate systems of rules and procedures.” <cite>(Hess 1995: 70)</cite>. I believe that this complex web of interwoven laws and norms led to the rise of reason among those not of the purely scientific persuasion — the religious. Instead of using science to combat or refute religious dogma, the Protestants used the two in combination to create a foundation which illuminated the rational and instrumental methodology behind God’s creation of the universe. Foregoing the obsolete imagery of Mother Nature, the Protestants saw the world as populated by inert objects created by God. “By seeing nature as inanimate, it became easier to think of it as being subjected to lawful patterns and regularities.” <cite>(Hess 1995: 75)</cite>. Thus, the Protestants were confident that God had given nature’s resources to humanity to use for self-improvement and to solve their problems. And since these resources were given to be used, there was no sin in exhausting their abundance or polluting the environment. From this emerged the Protestant work ethic and the idea that hard work and success in this life would lead to heavenly reward in the next. An individual’s choice of vocation had now become divine prescription. Protestantism was the answer to science and technology’s growth problem. Then came the intermediary that wove the three — technology, science, and Protestantism — together: capitalism, the originally economic (and increasingly cultural) system in which individuals or corporations exploit labor and resources in the pursuit of capital (or power). </p>

		        	<p>Concurrent to this new cultural evolution of nature, a fundamental reimagining of the human body was underway. Romanyshyn illustrates the pre-modern perception of the human body when he writes: “…the bodies depicted…are pantomimic bodies, bodies whose gestures are inseparable from the emotional situation and the story they enact…They have no inside in the sense of a source which originates the gestures…” <cite>(Romanyshyn 1989: 108)</cite>. For these pantomimic bodies, the body is seen as a highly mutable physical representation of intangible emotions. The body is not a mediator between the inside and the outside — there is only the body/self and the outside.</p>

		        	<p>As with nature, the rise of science was a key factor in the reinvention of the body. While some scientists looked outward to the cosmos, others drew their gazes inward. They sought to map the human body, to classify all its different conditions, and to eradicate its infirmities and inflictions. To do so, they studied corpses — cut them open to explore their inner workings. Such categorization and documentation required that each corpse be divorced from the identity of the individual who once inhabited it. The uniqueness had to be removed and the remainder extrapolated to all humanity. This is the birth of the anatomical body — immutable organic machines which express life and emotion as the result of function and mechanism. This led to the creation of models of the body made of wood, wax, plastic, or any other number of materials. Originally custom-crafted by hand and then later as standardized, mass-produced products, these models were used to educate the masses about the body. However, this was not the conclusion to the body’s reinvention. </p>

		        	<p>“We are no longer satisfied with a plastic imitation of an organic object, yet neither are we satisfied with nature’s own imperfect products.” <cite>(Van Dijck 2007: 640)</cite>. The paradigm again shifts, this time from one of imitation to one of modification. As discussed in Victoria Pitts’ <cite>In the Flesh: The Cultural Politics of Body Modification</cite>, the body is no longer unchanging. “The cyberpunk model rejects the Enlightenment understanding of the body as biologically fixed, presenting the body rather as always already shaped by human technologies…it assumes and sometimes champions the breakdown of traditional categories of subjectivity that are seen to be located in the body, such as sex and race.” <cite>(Pitts 2003: 155)</cite>. The body is now seen wholly as a mediator between the self and the outside, and as such, can be readily modified and customized to change what that mediation entails. For example, one can implant a camera with infrared capabilities and “…‘see’ electrical cords in the walls and even trace power lines to hidden cameras…” <cite>(Gray 2001: 9)</cite>.  I think that these new adaptations and modifications will allow for exponential growth in the creation of interests and abilities, which can only be a benefit to humanity’s diversity. It will also allow people who have been formerly disenfranchised to find likeminded individuals and groups.</p>

		        	<p>Unfortunately, I believe that this compulsion to separate the body from the self is not solely positive. It may be a factor behind modern society’s detachment from the individual. Instead of viewing other people as individual selves, they simply become ‘bodies,’ deindividuated and expendable. The effects of this are especially clear in the workplace, where employees are sometimes referred to as ‘bodies in seats.’ No longer do companies take the time to court individuals and offer them personalized incentives to work for them. No longer do they put in the effort to train new hires in the hopes that their increased abilities will benefit the company. They simply pick a name out of a database, and if that body doesn’t work out, then they choose the next one on the list. This devalues the modern self and seems to bring it down to the level of the machine, rather than that of the human.</p>

		        	<p>Our modern notions of nature and the body are not absolute or objective. They are the result of a gradual, centuries-long process, during which our cultural biases and prerogatives, and historical artifacts have subjectively shaped our perceptions of the world and our place within it. While some of the outcomes of this process are undoubtedly positive, others are just as undoubtedly negative. Much like the theory of evolution, this system does not seek to create good or bad; it merely enables the fit, the adapted, the unburdened to march onward into the future, heedless to the lives and cultures lost due to maladaptation. </p>
