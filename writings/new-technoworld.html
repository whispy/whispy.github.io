		        	<p>The advent of the modern technological era has seen our world shrink as instantaneous communication technologies have become widely available and diverse incompatible cultures have become increasingly homogenized. Yet, as the world has become smaller, our production of information and knowledge, and our control of nature have increased exponentially. As Nick Dyer-Witheford quotes from  Karl Marx, “…capital ‘by its nature drives beyond every spatial barrier’ so that ‘the creation of the physical conditions of exchange — of the means of communication and transport — the annihilation of space by time — becomes an extraordinary necessity…’” <cite>(Dyer-Witheford 1999: 131)</cite>. Modern capitalism is impelled to override and subsume all barriers in its path. The capitalist compulsions to grow, to redefine, and to control have permeated all cultures and driven us toward a reality in which forms of exploitation are excessively intensified and societies become shaped more by technology and science than by religion, philosophy, and human dreams. These new modes have emerged as the geminate concepts of technocapitalism and technoculture.</p>
		        	
		        	<p>The term technocapitalism is intended “…to signal the new syntheses…of capital, science, and technology.” <cite>(Best & Kellner 2001: 212)</cite>. It represents the integration of capitalism with technology and science, and illustrates how capitalist forces dominate “…production, distribution, and consumption, as well as other cultural, social, and political domains.” <cite>(Best & Kellner 2001: 212)</cite>. In the technocapitalist narrative, culture becomes a global commodity. National borders are made obsolete by fiber-optic and satellite webs woven by imperial states and international organizations. These networks allow for cultures — ideas, meanings, and values held by specific societies — to be packaged and exported around the world as entertainment, consumer goods, and knowledge. The global leader in this practice is the United States. Our main exports are not our cars, our machines, or our manufactured goods. They are our media — our TV shows, our movies, our music, and our literature. And naturally, our media are intrinsically shaped and defined by our culture. As a result, western culture unconsciously seeps into the minds of foreign consumers and influences their ideologies, shifting them away from their native cultures. The newly merged infotainment (information and entertainment) conglomerates “…become the vital agents for a reconstruction of global subjectivity carried out in the interests of transnational capital.” <cite>(Dyer-Witheford 1999: 137)</cite>.</p>

		        	<p>Another facet of technocapitalism is the rise of knowledge, information, and education as factors that manipulate class and national hierarchies by increasing the value of certain societal roles — the technocrats, technical workers, and ‘geeks’ — and decreasing the value of others — the trade workers, manufacturers, and manual laborers. “This is happening because capital is restructuring itself through the implementation of new science and technologies into every sphere of life and requires a high level of technological skills and education.” <cite>(Best & Kellner 2001: 214)</cite>. Labor that is seen as rote and unskilled is outsourced to third-world countries, in which manual labor has been so devalued that individuals will work for less than a living wage, and “those countries…that can render themselves hospitable…will attract well-paying ‘symbolic analytic’ jobs — the knowledge-based work associated with the design and development of new technologies.” <cite>(Dyer-Witheford 1999: 142)</cite>. Some believe that this transnational dividing of labor will be a rising tide that lifts all boats. This is true in some regards, as third-world nations will gain improvements in infrastructure and quality of life. However, by putting formerly isolated and independent labor markets in competition with one another, capitalism begins a “…‘race to the bottom’ whereby workers across the world are compelled to cheapen themselves into a job by competitively lowering their wages and conditions,” <cite>(Dyer-Witheford 1999: 143)</cite> and in doing so, intensifying their exploitation.</p>

		        	<p>The third major aspect of technocapitalism is the increasing power of transnational organizations. “Over the last decade, a round of regional and global trade agreements…[has] subordinated national policy to supranational agreements favoring unrestricted mobility of capital, deregulation, privatization, and unfettered markets.” <cite>(Dyer-Witheford 1999: 138)</cite>. The groups responsible for these subversions of nation-states comprise telecommunications companies, such as Vodafone and Bell; pharmaceutical companies, such as Pfizer; information-based companies, such as Google and Facebook; and agriculture companies, such as Monsanto. These capitalist organizations rely on new forms of technology and knowledge that occur as a result of the “…decline of the state and enlarged power for the market…” <cite>(Best & Kellner 2001: 212)</cite>. These forms include genetic engineering, nanotechnology, wireless networks, search histories, and Big Data. They have become indispensable to both the corporations that created them and the individuals that rely on them in order to work in the global knowledge-based economy. As such, people cannot avoid contributing to the power of transnational organizations if they wish to participate in the postindustrial world (though, as I will discuss later in this paper, they can subvert these technologies).</p>

		        	<p>Technoculture is the term used to describe cultures that are “…defined more by science and technology than by religion, social norms, ethics, or the humanities,” and in which technology “…becomes a driving source of change that overturns all stable traditions so rapidly that it impedes any attempt to control it, understand its nature, and discern its consequences.” <cite>(Dyer-Witheford 1999: 215)</cite>. It represents the critical point at which culture no longer constructs science and technology; science and technology become the constructors of culture. In the technocultural mode, technology increasingly pervades our daily lives, acting as a mediator for our sense of self, of nature, and of every day relations. Technologies begin to “…exist as more than mediums of communication; they function as an environment that is separate from the content of a given message and rooted in the form and logic…” <cite>(Standlee 2012; 95-96)</cite> of mediation. Instead of the users choosing how their technology interprets the fabric of reality, the technology becomes the very reality that is perceived. All of our experiences become mediated, “…subsumed into a social world that is shaped primarily by technological connection,” <cite>(Standlee 2012: 98)</cite> alienated from our biological selves. This alienation and mediation silhouettes the existence of a void where once was nature and the self, raw and visceral. In order to fill this maw, we have created a society of megaspectacles and pseudo-events. “They range from superhyped films like the Star Wars series, to theme parks that create intense and thrilling…mediated experiences, to media-generated passion plays like the O.J. Simpson trial or the Clinton…scandals that are marked by such saturation coverage, repeated day after day, that they define an era of spectacle.” <cite>(Best & Kellner 2001: 227)</cite>.</p>

		        	<p>The second feature of the technoculture is the escalating replacement of human labor by automated machines. “Thanks to factory assembly techniques, robotics, and computers, automated systems are increasingly running the work world…Soon, futurists tell us, the home will be completely automated…” <cite>(Best & Kellner 2001: 216)</cite>. While automation could lead to more individual freedom — the ability to create, explore, and experience without having to worry about working — it has so far been used to “…intensify work, profits, the extraction of surplus value,…and [increase] unemployment as workers are thrown onto the scrap heap of social waste.” <cite>(Best & Kellner 2001: 216)</cite>. As an example, “…nearly 270,000 production jobs were lost…” in Detroit due to automation of automobile creation, and “…the unemployment level among Detroit’s majority black population was 27 percent.” <cite>(Williams 2001: 158)</cite>.</p>
		        	<p>The third feature of the technoculture is the rise of the technoconsciousness — forms of thought governed by mathematics, analytics, and algorithms, where binary states supersede spectra and “‘…one-dimensional thought’ supplants critical and dialectical reason.” <cite>(Best & Kellner 2001: 216)</cite>. Knowledge and wisdom are no longer inherently liberating and expanding forces, and the study of philosophy, literature, and the humanities is seen as having little value. Adolescents do not choose their majors based on what they enjoy; instead, they hone in on a specific area of a field in which they will be able to make money, ignoring unrelated skills and topics as distractions. However, as all disciplines become increasingly digitized, the ability of individuals in “…fields once separated by disparate methods, technologies, and practices…” <cite>(Best & Kellner 2001: 217)</cite> to collaborate on a global scale increases.</p>

		        	<p>The last feature of the technoculture is that one’s social life becomes replaced by communities that are technologically and commercially mediated. Social interactions become increasingly virtualized as people communicate and relate through digital media, such as email, texting, disposable image apps (e.g. Snapchat), and social websites (e.g. Facebook). In this environment, the nature of intimacy shifts as our expectations change. Prior to our hyper-connected world, one had little expectation of availability. This allowed people to divide their time between maintaining social circles and performing maintenance on the self in solitude. Today, the expectation is that one will be available constantly, co-present and connected. “The social expectation that someone is available…functions as a kind of glue that holds groups of friends, and even extended social networks, together.” <cite>(Standlee 2012: 100)</cite>. Disconnecting has negative social consequences — one may be seen as uncaring or cold — and this is interpreted as rejection. However, in the virtual world, information becomes a shared resource and anyone can teach everyone. “Internet chat rooms allow people to meet, explore mutual interests, and create communities…People from the entire world can thus share information, discussion, and cultural forms from which they were earlier excluded.” <cite>(Best & Kellner 2001: 217)</cite>.</p>
		        	
		        	<p>In response to the technocapitalist and technocultural modes, multiple forms of opposition and resistance have arisen. These technoresistances utilize the same technologies that transnational organizations have woven into webs of exploitation in order to subvert their participation in the postindustrial world. “…The very communication channels that circulate commodities also circulate struggles.” <cite>(Dyer-Witheford 1999: 146)</cite>. One method of technoresistance is to embrace your role, and in doing so, subvert it. The progenitors of the Detroit techno movement foresaw the future of automation, in which robots would replace them, and decided to become robots themselves. This allowed them to control their own identities. It became “…a form of power; robots, after all, are stronger, tougher, and more enduring than mere humans.” <cite>(Williams 2001: 161)</cite>. They created their own vision of the future, one in which they were able to become more than they had previously been.</p>

		        	<p>Another form of technoresistance that uses the technocapitalist network is the creation of solidarity movements that are able to cross borders and wield power because of their strong and diverse memberships. Examples include “…the Asia Labour Monitor Resource Centre… [circulating] information about worker struggles in China, Taiwan, South Korea, and Hong Kong; Mujer a Mujer, a collective of Mexican, U.S., Canadian, and Caribbean women’s groups representing waged and unwaged female labor who use on-line communication in their transcontinental opposition…” <cite>(Dyer-Witheford 1999: 152)</cite>. There are also similar movements that oppose capital power not from the labor side, but the consumption side. “This manifests in a number of ways — ‘adbusting,’ cultural jamming, media piracy…” <cite>(Dyer-Witheford 1999: 153)</cite> and transnational boycotts.</p>

		        	<p>The technocapitalist and technocultural narratives have restructured our economies, our cultures, and our selves. They have intensified already present forms of exploitation, and have detached us from connections to nature and the self that had existed for millennia. However, the innate human capacity for opposition has been preserved — technoresistance groups have been created and covenants of solidarity have been entered. The future we look forward to is one in which transnational organizations and opposition movements war against each other with bullets of information on battlefields of knowledge.</p>
