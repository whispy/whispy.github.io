		        	<p>Wherein I take issue with Janis Jenkins' black and white view in <cite class="title">Pharmaceutical Self: The Global Shaping of Experience in an Age of Psychopharmacology</cite>.</p>

		        	<p>“For example, taking second generation or ‘atypical’ antipsychotics (and many antidepressants) generally involves considerable weight gain and blunting of sexual desire such that persons much ‘choose’ to be ‘crazy’ or fat, sexless, and genderless.” Jenkins assumes that the choice of a mentally ill patient to take certain medications despite potential negative effects is a paradox. The determination is that being crazy or “fat, sexless, and genderless” are both options that are weighted the same. The paradox is that one must choose between two equally inimical values. However, this is simply not a valid interpretation of the choice that mentally ill people must make. The reality is that the judgment is fundamentally binary — to function or not to function. In most cases where one would seek out and gain access to antipsychotics or antidepressants, there are likely some detrimental effects that already occur as a result of one being unmedicated. These effects can be so pronounced that they can prohibit one from functioning normally in even the most basic of ways.</p>

		        	<p>Thus, the choice is to be medicated, functioning, and maybe fat or sexless, or completely dysfunctional. This is clearly an imbalanced ballot. For example, take a person with severe depression. They are likely not sexually active because they may feel ashamed of themselves, may have little social contact, and may simply not be seen as an attractive sexual partner because of their condition. They may also be fat, as it is very common for depressed individuals to find small measures of solace in food, especially in times of stress. It is also likely that they do not exercise. So, the typical depressed individual may be depressed, sexless, and fat while unmedicated. But, if they were to take antidepressants, they could potentially alleviate their depression. They may even be able to overcome the negative effects of the medication, as their newfound functionality could open doors that were previously closed. They may eat less from stress and may have the energy to exercise. They may go out to bars, parties, and other social events. The choice is clearly not just between being crazy or being fat, sexless, and genderless. It is between functionality and dysfunctionality.</p>
