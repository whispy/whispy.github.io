			    	<h2>An Analysis of Psychoactive Drugs and Genetic Technologies</h2>
			    	<h3>This essay is written from the perspective of a fictional human in Octavia Butler's novel <cite class="title">Dawn</cite>. It is not intended to be a comprehensive dissection of humanity's history with psychoative drugs or genetics. The stances taken throughout are those of the fictional character, based on their experiences with nuclear warfare and associating with non-hierarchical extraterrestrial life.</h3>

		        	<p>Many among us recently Awakened humans were probably under the influence of some form of psychoactive drug — antidepressants, antipsychotics, hallucinogens, stimulants — when the bombs went off and the long nuclear winter began. We each had what were, at the time, valid reasons to ingest them. Some needed them simply to function within the inhospitable environment that was modern culture. Some took them to be more productive and more competitive. Others sought to escape, to seek wisdom, or to just have a good time. They allowed us to change our perceptions and to experience realities other than our own. Our rational and enlightened society attempted to obfuscate the truth that it viewed as shameful by burying “…the shamanic narrative of flight, transformation, and return…” <cite>(Plant 1999: 100)</cite> and erecting a new imagery in which “the body [was] silently disordered…waiting to be evaluated and measured…” <cite>(Dumit 2012: 85)</cite>. A new narrative was constructed in which science had all the answers and all the cures. This was the end result of a process that had begun with Plato in the 5th century B.C. This process was a slow evolution during which reverence for the shamanic journey as a transformative and visionary experience was forsaken in favor of the Platonic insistence on observability, rationality, and objective truth.</p>

		        	<p>The shamanic narrative can be traced back thousands of years before Plato’s birth to the ancient nomadic cultures that arose when the ice age ended and the glaciers receded. Shamans in these cultures would use natural psychoactive agents “…to induce journeys from which they returned with prophecies, solutions, remedies, and songs.” <cite>(Plant 1999: 98)</cite>. It continued as a cultural force in ancient Greece. “It is said that the Delphic oracle was transmitted by a priestess who sat ‘astride a cleft in the earth from which subterranean vapors arose.’ It is sometimes suggested that the priestess was also inhaling the smoke of smoldering henbane.” <cite>(Plant 1999: 103)</cite>. It was at this point that Plato entered the story. Western societies before the nuclear war were founded on his philosophies, which rejected the body and the physical as “…corrupting, even evil, [influences] on what would otherwise be pure thought.” <cite>(Plant 1999: 104)</cite>. This concept became the foundation upon which Christianity was constructed. The Platonic ideal of physical purity as freeing became the Christian ideal of physical purity as divine. In medieval Europe, men and women who were believed to engage in “…banquets, orgies, desecrations of the Sacrament, and homages to the devil…” <cite>(Plant 1999: 94)</cite> were hunted and persecuted by the Church. They were tried as witches, but the strange thing is that they often confessed their guilt to such wild accusations. The reason for this is that the unguents, ointments, and salves which they were purported to use for “…animal metamorphoses, flights, [and] apparitions of the devil…” <cite>(Plant 1999: 95)</cite> actually contained psychoactive substances, such as hemlock, monkshood, nightshade, and henbane. They were not actually confessing to consorting with the devil or changing into animals; they were simply confessing their trips. Their philosophy of the physical and adherence to a modified shamanic narrative was antithetical to the values espoused by the Church. The inquisitions tipped the scale toward the Platonic ideal and away from the shamanic journey.</p>

		        	<p>At this point, the once open and accepted use of psychoactive substances was forced underground and made taboo. This status quo existed for many years (and still does for most hallucinogens), but in the early 1900s, something new happened — the desire for productivity outstripped the human capacity for productivity. The capitalist hegemony faced a stagnation of growth and, in order to overcome this, they co-opted the chemicals of the shamanic narrative and stripped them of their mystical and spiritual trappings. They then reintroduced them as new techniques for increasing human ability, one of which was a compound known as amphetamine sulfate. Also known as speed, amphetamines could “…energize and stimulate, enhancing performance and perceptions.” <cite>(Plant 1999: 120)</cite>. Capitalism had found the class of drugs that was needed to perpetuate growth. However, this previously shamanic class could not simply be introduced as such, or it would validate the shamanic journey, and in doing so, validate things that could not be seized, stripped, and commoditized, like the “...occult dimensions of psychic reality” and the “…collective consciousness of the natural world…” <cite>(Pinchbeck 2002: 153, 154)</cite>. A new narrative was created wherein the chemicals were classified as “…a transformative magic in the form of science…” <cite>(Jenkins 2010: 4)</cite> and previously normal human conditions were pathologized and medicalized. Normality became substandard and hypernormality, in the form of speed, became “…the default drug, the bottom line.” <cite>(Plant 1999: 120)</cite>.</p>

		        	<p>This subversion of psychoactive substances into the psychopharmaceutical industry is one of the main reasons why I do not believe we Awakened should explore such drugs as a technology. Our only experiences with them were ones controlled by the pharmaceutical industry, so the only ways in which we have learned to use them are as branded ways for the capitalist hegemony to “…identify [our] objective self for [us]…” <cite>(Dumit 2012: 62)</cite>. We cannot allow this method of thinking to persist in our new communities. Thinking in the grammar of the pharmacological would only return us to a hierarchical state in which class disparities are created by individuals’ choices. For example, let us imagine that we develop a psychoactive drug which enabled those who took it to see the future. This would offer massive advantages to those who chose to partake. They would be able to outwit opponents, gain any amount of resources they desired, and most seductively, manipulate others in order to achieve certain outcomes. These behaviors can be based entirely in altruistic intentions — guiding a child away from adversity or bringing together two individuals as romantic partners — but they still create power disparities. Manipulating others, even with good intentions, presumes that you have more power than they. By allowing individuals to choose whether to become more advanced, we would create hierarchies of power — those who consent and those who refuse.</p>

		        	<p>The other reason why I do not believe we should explore psychopharmaceutical drugs is this — we have the ooloi. The ability of the ooloi to manipulate human genetics far outstrips the power of any drug we could hope to develop. They have specific organs that allow them to perceive on a cellular level and to learn everything about an individual from their genes. They can also use these organs to manipulate said cells and genes with an extraordinarily high level of precision. In one instance, an ooloi induced a human’s body to simply reabsorb a cancerous tumor. We could not have even conceived of doing this with the drugs available before the war. And then the things that the ooloi believe they will be able to do with the information they gain from analyzing the cancer are even more incredible. “Regeneration of lost limbs. Controlled malleability…Even increased longevity…” <cite>(Butler 1987: 40)</cite>. They were also able to strengthen our immune systems, make us heal more quickly, and make us stronger — all by manipulating our genes. The oolois’ abilities clearly negate any need for us to develop drugs that affect our physical self, such as stimulants or steroids. Any improvements that we could gain from such drugs, we could also gain from the ooloi in less time and with less effort.</p>

		        	<p>As for drugs that manipulate our senses and perceptions, like hallucinogens or antidepressants, the abilities of the ooloi are still far superior to anything we have previously had. They have sensory hands that allow them to create direct neural linkages with others. This connection allows the transmission of any experiences or sensations that one could imagine. For example, they can facilitate a sexual coupling that seems almost transcendent. Here is a description I was given of one such congress: “Now their delight in one another ignited and burned. They moved together, sustaining an impossible intensity, both of them tireless, perfectly matched, ablaze in sensation, lost in one another. They seemed to rush upward. A long time later, they seemed to drift down slowly, gradually, savoring a few moments wholly together.” <cite>(Butler 1987: 163)</cite>. If they can create this experience by jacking into one’s central nervous system, then I doubt there is any limit as to the types of experiences they can create.</p>

		        	<p>Humanity’s history with genetic manipulation, while not as linearly exploitive as our history with drugs, has not been without its peaks and valleys. There have been some positive aspects, but there has also been massive exploitation. It only goes back a few hundred years, rather than thousands. In 1912, a French surgeon named Alexis Carrel became famous for purportedly growing a chicken heart from a small slice of chicken heart tissue kept in culture. His hope was to eventually grow whole organs, which he could then mail to others for transplantation. Unfortunately, Carrel’s achievement was tainted when it was revealed that he was a eugenicist. He believed that “…organ transplantation and life extension were ways to preserve what he saw as the superior white race, which he believed was being polluted by less intelligent and inferior stock, namely the poor, uneducated, and nonwhite.” <cite>(Skloot 2010: 59)</cite>. In the 1930s, researchers from the US Public Health Services began to study syphilis at the Tuskegee Institute. While their goal — to find a way to eradicate the virus — was admirable, their methodology was not. “They recruited hundreds of African-American men with syphilis, then watched them die slow, painful, and preventable deaths, even after they realized penicillin could cure them.” <cite>(Skloot 2010: 50)</cite>.</p>

		        	<p>As for the positive aspects of humanity’s genetic forays, a major one was the ability of same-sex couples to have children with the aid of sperm banks. Lesbian couples were able to use donor catalogs, grid-based publications which quickly provided basic information about sperm donors — photos, names, ages, traits — and allowed them to rapidly filter and sort the list. After narrowing their choices, the couples would then request an in-depth donor profile, in which donors would “…respond to a series of open-ended questions such as ‘Describe your hobbies and interests…’” <cite>(Mamo 2007: 203)</cite> and so on. In this manner, lesbian couples were able to select for traits that they believed would make their children more mentally and physically fit, which would, in turn, improve their odds of being successful adults. This also had the effect of increasing cultural acceptance for varied gender and lifestyle preferences.</p>

		        	<p>Yet, despite the beneficial and progressive aspects of our history with genetic experimentation, hierarchies of race, class, and gender were still created. Once again, by allowing individuals to choose whether to participate or not, humanity allowed power disparities to form. In any situation where individuals have the choice to advance, there will always be those who will not or cannot do so, and in their refusal, hierarchies are created. The reason why I believe that using the ooloi in place of developed technologies will not create hierarchies is simple — they do not give us a choice. They believe that their interpretations of our biology should supersede any conscious refusals we may make. As an example, the ooloi Nikanj forced a man named Joseph to be enhanced — it made him “…more difficult to injure, faster to heal, and able to…recover from injuries that would have killed him before” <cite>(Butler 1987: 161)</cite> — despite Joseph’s spoken desire to remain unchanged. It simply decided that he needed extra protection, whether he liked it or not. In another instance, the same ooloi makes a woman named Lilith pregnant without her permission. The reason it gave was that it believed she was ready to be a mother and that “…nothing about [her] but [her] words [rejected] this child.” <cite>(Butler 1987: 246)</cite>. By eliminating choice as a factor, the ooloi obviate the creation of hierarchies completely. If every human is forced to advance, then every human will still be equal relative to one another.</p>

		        	<p>Our ingrained languages of psychopharmacology and genetic manipulation are inherently hierarchical. They were created in a society formed around hierarchies and there is no way to separate them from this intrinsic characteristic. To adopt the ooloi as custodians of our senses and genetics is the best option. And even if you disagree, I doubt they will give you a choice.</p>
