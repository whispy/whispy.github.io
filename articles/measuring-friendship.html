		        	<p>I recently read <a href="http://alecea.com/PDFs/Alecea_Standlee_Friends_Romance_Online_Techno-Interaction_Relationships_Among_College_Students.pdf">Alicia Standlee’s <cite class="title">Friends and Romance Online: Techno-Interaction and Relationships Among College Students</cite></a> and wanted to share some things that I found interesting.</p>

		        	<p>“These technologies exist as more than mediums of communication; they function as an environment that is separate from the content of a given message and rooted in the form and logic of that techno-social environment.” Different methods of communication each have their own particular rules and behaviors, some of which are intrinsic and some of which are constructed. These particulars then shape the context in which the communications are sent and received. I fear that with so many methods — each with their own associated rulesets and behaviors — miscommunication has become the norm. I try to divorce my content from the medium as much as is possible because of my desire for clarity. I don’t use ‘textspeak’, I generally ignore character limits, and so on. I think that this is not only the most effective method for communication, but also the easiest, as I don’t have to memorize the intricacies of each individual medium. However, it is also not possible for me to fully divorce content and medium; I cannot overcome the basic differences between audial, visual, and textual media. In addition to these encouraged behaviors, most media also have unwritten rules, and breaking these rules can insult others. For example, if someone texts me saying something that does not require a response, they may still feel slighted if I don’t send some form of acknowledgement at all.</p>

		        	<p>“The social expectation that someone is available if needed functions as a kind of glue that holds groups of friends, and even extended social networks, together.” I think that this expectation of availability is a basic component of intimacy (which includes friendships, familial relationships, and more serious relationships). One relies on those with whom one is intimate to be available, when needed, to be at one’s side, ready to help with whatever task is at hand. Prior to our hyper-connected world, this expectation of availability was sporadic — maybe you needed help moving furniture, getting over a break-up, or simply wanted to hang out. This allowed people to divide their time. They could maintain their social circle, fulfill their social obligations, but they were also able to perform maintenance on the self by dint of the default state being ‘disconnected’. However, the modern default is ‘connected’, and the expectation of availability is not dynamic, but constant. There is no time for the self; there is only time for the collective.</p>

		        	<p>“The message being sent by a speedy response is that the friendship is valuable and important to both parties. A delayed response is an indication that the friendship is not valued by the ‘slower’ respondent.” This idea that response speed inversely correlated to important is not something that I’ve found in my own experiences. I find that some of my closest friends are the ones who take the most time to respond, and I think that our shared understanding that one of us can respond slowly without insulting the other is a mark of our closeness. I understand that they are individuals who do not exist solely to converse with me — I am not the center of the universe. Therefore, I can trust that their response time is not a measure of friendship, but simply a variable which has no truck with my perceived importance.</p>
