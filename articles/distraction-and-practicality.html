		        	<p>“It appears that in a technoculture the passion for wisdom and learning as intrinsic goods often gives way to anxious desires for a career and success.” The section of Steven Best and Douglas Kellner’s <cite class="title">The Post Modern Adventure</cite> in which this quote resides really resonated for me. I value knowledge as an inherently liberating and expanding force, yet I also feel that I need to hone in on a specific area of study in order to eventually achieve some form of financial stability. To that end, I often find myself discounting time spent exploring other fields or practicing other skills as ‘distractions,’ despite believing that such times also have an inherent value. This conflict is something that I have been struggling with for years. At first, it was unconscious and I only knew there was some dissonance because what I wanted to know and what I had to know did not match, but I had no explanations as to why. It has only been in the past year or two that I’ve been able to illuminate this struggle in my mind. How do I provide myself with economic stability while still being able to pursue the things that I enjoy? How do I apportion the time to explore and experience when I must constantly be improving my skills in order to stay ahead of the “technocrats and technical workers”? How do I reconcile my desire to have things and do things with my desire to be things and live things? I think that all these questions arise from the same conflict. While certainly a significant conflict, it is by no means a new one. Unfortunately, I have not yet found an answer which I find satisfactory.</p>

		        	<p>“For O’Blivion, ‘public life on television was much more real than private life in the flesh.’ Thus his death had no sting…” While Best and Kellner view this as the next phase of human evolution, I feel that this speaks to a much more significant aspect of modern civilization — the desire to be known, to be remembered, to have made an impact. If you simply exist, you will be forgotten. If you do not contribute, you will be forgotten. If you do not create a spectacle, you will be forgotten. Shamanic and tribal societies remembered their ancestors in the form of spirits who would watch over and care for their descendants. They did not have to prove themselves in order to be remembered; they simply had to have lived. We do not have the same luxury in our constantly growing and changing society. With our understanding of the world being enhanced by our globe-spanning networks, we come to the realization that we are one among multitudes, and we seek to be unique in order to be remembered. And no one wants to be forgotten, left behind, labeled as ‘not important.’ That strikes at some deep human fear and drives us to seek immortality. I am reminded of Glen Cook’s <cite class="title">Black Company</cite> series, in which fallen members of a mercenary company have their names engraved in magic pillars for all eternity, seeking to be remembered. One of the characters has a refrain about this practice: “It is immortality, of a sort.”</p>
